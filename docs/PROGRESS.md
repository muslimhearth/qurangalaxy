Per-goal detail: `docs/progress/`.

## Main-session decisions
- `Occurrence.w` holds Tanzil word positions, not corpus numbers. In 4 verses (2:181, 8:6, 13:37, 37:130) the corpus joins two Tanzil words into one; `scripts/lib/wordmap.ts` maps them and the build stops on any unknown mismatch.
- Tanzil copyright notice ships as `public/data/NOTICE.txt` (JSON cannot hold comments).

- Real-data clusters checked: sizes 408 to 18, grouped by theme (e.g. hearing/sight/heart; paradise/rivers/food). No tuning needed.

- G5 fixes found by browser tests: Escape could not close the panel after a search; the title bar showed through the glassy bottom sheet on phones.

## Known issues / next ideas
- Labels of the ~20 most frequent roots overlap in the dense core; a label-spacing pass would help.
- The "connected roots" list can be long (40+ chips) and pushes verses down on phones; cap it with "show more".
- On select, the camera centers the root on the full screen; on desktop the side panel covers the right part. Offset the target left when the panel is open.
- R3F still bundles three's `WebGLRenderer` (unused) and logs two library deprecation warnings.
